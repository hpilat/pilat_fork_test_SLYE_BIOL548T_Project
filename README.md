# SLYE_BIOL548T_Project
This repository was created for a course designed by the LDP in order to showcase how a OSF can work

Originally Created on September 15th, 2022 by Sadie Lye. 

The function of this repistor is not the analysis undertaken, rather it is about showing how to correctly 
construct a repository, push, and connect it to OSF. 

The repository contains the files one might expect to see in a typical ecological study including 
data, scripts, figures, manuscript, etc. 


This project is being reviewed by Hannah Pilat
